This folder contains all of the 2500 generated polymers from the RT model reported in the manuscript ([link to preprint](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/63e668409da0bc6b33b1870c)). The polymers are broken into groups of 50 and serialized into CMDL notebooks (.cmdnb extension). Opening a notebook and running all the cells will produce visualized structures of the polymeric materials. In certain cases, errors may result arising from missing components or invalid SMILES strings, as noted in the manuscript. Future work will be aimed at improving the generation/validation process.
