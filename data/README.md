This folder contains data surrounding the training and output surrounding the polymer RT described in the [manuscript](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/63e668409da0bc6b33b1870c)

The [generated_polymers](./generated_polymers/) folder contains CMDL notebook files with all 2500 generated polymers described in the manuscript.

The [polymerData.json](polymerData.json) file contains all of the experimental polymer data from historical datasets and their graph representation used to train the RT for polymer generation described in the manuscript.

The [generated_blockcopolymer.csv](generated_blockcopolymer.csv) file contains the generated output from the RT model.
