# Variable Tutorial

Using CMDL we can define variables and templates to streamline the creation of records with similar reactions. For instance, if a particular experiment is running multiple reactions with minor changes to the reagents or parameters, then using variables can assist in streamlining their documentation.

:::warning
Use of variables is still currently under development. A full tutorial will be posted once the API is stable.
